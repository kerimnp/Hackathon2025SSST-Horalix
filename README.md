# 🩻 Radiology AI Assistant & Antibiotic Management Platform

## 🚀 Project Overview

In just 48 hours, our team built two powerful healthcare tools designed to support clinical decision-making, improve patient outcomes, and combat antibiotic resistance.

- The **Radiology AI Assistant** provides instant, explainable insights on chest X-rays to aid in fast and accurate triage.
- The **Antibiotic Management App** empowers doctors with an all-in-one platform to prescribe safely, view patient data, check drug interactions, and access evidence-based treatment guidelines.

These tools are designed to be lightweight, practical, and usable in real-world clinical workflows — especially in under-resourced or high-pressure environments.

## 🧠 Features

### 📷 Radiology AI Assistant
- Upload chest X-ray images
- Real-time AI-based diagnosis (e.g., pneumonia, nodules)
- Heatmap visualizations for explainability
- Severity triage: prioritize critical cases
- Built-in feedback flow for continuous learning

### 💊 Antibiotic Prescription & Clinical Dashboard
- Create and manage prescriptions
- Issue referral letters (uputnica)
- Enter and view patient history and lab results
- Check for drug interactions
- View up-to-date antibiotic treatment guidelines
- Monitor regional antibiotic resistance trends (simulated)
- Doctor dashboard with patient follow-up tracking

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Tools / Frameworks |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend** | React.js / Streamlit (depending on demo version) |
| **Backend** | Python, FastAPI |
| **AI/ML** | Pretrained CNN model for chest X-ray interpretation |
| **Data** | Simulated datasets (resistance, interactions, labs) |
| **Database** | SQLite / PostgreSQL |
| **Visualization** | Plotly, Matplotlib, custom dashboards |
| **Deployment** | Local app + demo server setup |

## 📈 Future Potential

- Integration with real hospital EMRs (via FHIR)
- Live connection to resistance surveillance APIs (e.g., WHO GLASS)
- Mobile app for rural or emergency use
- QR code summaries for patient handouts
- AI-based treatment suggestions based on full patient context

## ❤️ Built With Purpose

We created these tools not just as prototypes, but as proof that even in 48 hours, technology can meaningfully amplify clinical care.
